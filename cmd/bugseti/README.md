# BugSETI

**Distributed Bug Fixing - like SETI@home but for code**

BugSETI is a system tray application that helps developers contribute to open source by fixing bugs in their spare CPU cycles. It fetches issues from GitHub repositories, prepares context using AI, and guides you through the fix-and-submit workflow.

## Features

- **System Tray Integration**: Runs quietly in the background, ready when you are
- **Issue Queue**: Automatically fetches and queues issues from configured repositories
- **AI Context Seeding**: Prepares relevant code context for each issue using pattern matching
- **Workbench UI**: Full-featured interface for reviewing issues and submitting fixes
- **Automated PR Submission**: Streamlined workflow from fix to pull request
- **Stats & Leaderboard**: Track your contributions and compete with the community

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://forge.lthn.ai/core/cli.git
cd core

# Build BugSETI
task bugseti:build

# The binary will be in build/bin/bugseti
```

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or later
- Node.js 18+ and npm (for frontend)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated
- Chrome/Chromium (optional, for webview features)

## Configuration

On first launch, BugSETI will show an onboarding wizard to configure:

1. **GitHub Token**: For fetching issues and submitting PRs
2. **Repositories**: Which repos to fetch issues from
3. **Filters**: Issue labels, difficulty levels, languages
4. **Notifications**: How to alert you about new issues

### Configuration File

Settings are stored in `~/.config/bugseti/config.json`:

```json
{
  "github_token": "ghp_...",
  "repositories": [
    "host-uk/core",
    "example/repo"
  ],
  "filters": {
    "labels": ["good first issue", "help wanted", "bug"],
    "languages": ["go", "typescript"],
    "max_age_days": 30
  },
  "notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sound": true
  },
  "fetch_interval_minutes": 30
}
```

## Usage

### Starting BugSETI

```bash
# Run the application
./bugseti

# Or use task runner
task bugseti:run
```

The app will appear in your system tray. Click the icon to see the quick menu or open the workbench.

### Workflow

1. **Browse Issues**: Click the tray icon to see available issues
2. **Select an Issue**: Choose one to work on from the queue
3. **Review Context**: BugSETI shows relevant files and patterns
4. **Fix the Bug**: Make your changes in your preferred editor
5. **Submit PR**: Use the workbench to create and submit your pull request
